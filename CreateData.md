# Tree Collection Database Survey 

Created a new and empty layer for a framework for my data

# Feature Layer ( hosted) information linked below

## Item ID:

df72c711db6348ed995d4e5ffde2de98

## Layer URL

https://services1.arcgis.com/pMeXRvgWClLJZr3s/arcgis/rest/services/tree_collection_database_survey1/FeatureServer

## Trying to add data from my new empty hosted layer in map veiwer!

I kept getting an error when trying to add a point in my map, I kept adding this layer with "Add to new map with full editing control" still nothing would happen. I create multiple different layers in ArcGIS Developers to see if that was the problem.

I have provided screen shots below
